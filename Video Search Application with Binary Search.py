# Task 1: Implement the binary search algorithm for searching videos by title.



# Task 2: Develop a REST API endpoint using Flask that allows users to search for videos by their titles using the binary search developed in Task 1. This API should accept a search query as input and return the matching videos, if any.



# Task 3: Test the video search functionality using Postman or a similar tool. Send requests to the API endpoint created in Task 2 with different search queries to verify its correctness and efficiency. Ensure that the API returns the expected results for both existing and non-existing videos.
